Terminology
===========

The key words "MUST" and "MUST NOT" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [#RFC2119]_

Abstract
========

This proposal specifies three possible approaches for integrating the blind off-chain lightweight transaction (Bolt) protocol [#bolt-paper]_ into Zcash.

Motivation
==========

Layer 2 protocols like Lightning enable scalable payments for Bitcoin but lack the mechanisms to provide strong privacy guarantees on the payment network. Zcash offers private transactions but currently lacks features that would enable a lightning-style payment channel. This proposal specifies an integration of the Bolt privacy-preserving Lightning protocol on top of Zcash [#bolt-paper]_.

Specification
=============

This specification details two potential approaches to integrating the features of Bolt into Zcash and depends on a ZIP that introduces Whitelisted Transparent Programs (WTPs) [#wtp-programs]_.

1. General requirements for Bolt protocol
--------------------------

Private payment channels as designed by the Bolt protocol require the following capabilities to achieve the stated anonymity properties at layer 2:

(1) Ability to create a funding transaction such that the transaction inputs are anonymous.
(2) Ability to escrow funds to a multi-signature address with a fix for transaction malleability.
(3) Ability to do relative time locks for commitment transactions to support unilateral channel closing.
(4) Ability to do absolute and relative time locks to support multi-hop payments.
(5) Ability to validate Bolt-specific commitment opening message and closing signature using WTPs:

    - check the validity of the commitment opening
    - check the validity of randomized/blinded signature on the wallet commitment in closure token
    - check the validity of revocation token signature in the event of a channel dispute by merchant

(6) Ability to verify the transaction output using WTPs such that:

    - if customer initiated closing, first output pays out to customer with a time lock (to allow merchant to dispute customer balance) and second output pays out to merchant immediately
    - if merchant initiated closing, a single output that pays the merchant the full balance of the channel with a time lock that allows for customer dispute

**Channel Operation Assumptions.**
 - Single-funded channel by customer with a minimum fee paid to the merchant.
 - Either the customer or the merchant can initiate channel closing.
 - If the customer initiates closing, then the merchant can dispute the closing transaction if they disagrees with the closure token in the closing transaction.
 - If the merchant initiates closing, the customer has the opportunity to post their own valid closing transaction. In this case, the merchant has an additional opportunity to validate this closing transaction and can dispute if necessary.

1.1 Conditions for Opening Channel
-------------

To open a channel, a customer picks a channel-specific public key, commits to an initial wallet, and receives a signature from the merchant (using their long-term keypair) on that wallet. A wallet consists of a wallet-specific public key, a customer balance, and a total channel balance, and is linked to the customer's channel-specific public key. The channel specific public key, initial customer balance, total channel balance, and initial wallet commitment comprise the customer's channel token.

The keypairs used by both the merchant and the customer must support a blind signature scheme.

1.2 Conditions for Closing Channel
-------------

A customer should be able to close the channel by either opening the initial wallet commitment (if no payments made) or posting a closing token.

A merchant should be able to close the channel by either posting their closing token or, if the customer posts an outdated version of their closure token (or opens the initial wallet commitment for the channel after one or more payments have been made), a revocation token.

2. Transparent/Shielded Tx: Using T/Z-addresses and Scripting Opcodes
-------------

We assume the following specific features are present:

(1) ``OP_CLTV`` - absolute lock time
(2) ``OP_CSV`` - relative lock time
(3) Can specify shielded inputs and outputs
(4) Support for whitelisted transparent programs (WTPs) that enables 2-of-2 multi-sig style transactions
(5) A non-SegWit approach that enables transaction non-malleability
(6) ``OP_BOLT`` opcode logic expressed as WTPs: a transparent program that takes as input a predicate, witness and context then outputs a ``True`` or ``False`` on the stack. Below is the logic for the two transparent programs:

    * ``bolt_close`` program (for customer-initiated or merchant-initiated close). This program is structured as follows:
    
        (a) ``predicate``: the customer and merchant public keys along with the channel token (which comprises public parameters, the initial balances and optionally, the initial wallet commitment)
	(b) ``witness``: consists of three arguments: first argument indicates whether the customer or merchant initiated close and is represented by a single byte (``0x0`` or ``0x1``).
	
	    - if the customer-initiated close, then the subsequent bytes are interpreted as a **closing token** and **customer signature**.
	    - if the merchant-initiated close, then the subsequent bytes are interpreted as a standard multi-sig and parses signatures for the **customer** and **merchant**.
	    
	(c) ``context``: the number of created outputs in the transaction, time delay and etc. (TODO: flesh this out) 
	(d) ``verify_program`` logic:
	
	    - if customer-initiated closing, then verify the closing token and customer signature. In addition, checks that 2 new outputs are created, with the specified balances, each paying a ``bolt_cust_spend`` WTP containing the revocation hash and the respective pubkey
	    - if merchant-initiated closing, then verify the merchant signature and customer signature. In addition, checks that ...

    * ``bolt_merch_spend`` program (for merchant dispute of customer closure token). This mode is used in a merchant closing transaction to dispute a customer's closure token. The opcode expects a merchant revocation token. It validates the revocation token with respect to the wallet pub key posted by the customer in the customer's closing transaction. If valid, the customer's closure token will be invalidated and the merchant's closing transaction will be deemed valid.

**Privacy Limitations**. The aggregate balance of the channel will be revealed in the 2-of-2 multisig transparent address. Similarly, the final splitting of funds will be revealed to the network. However, for channel opening and closing, the identity of the participants remain hidden. Channel opening and closing will also be distinguishable on the network due to use of WTPs.

**Channel Opening**. The customer creates a funding/escrow transaction that spends ZEC from a shielded address to a transparent output that is encumbered by a Bolt transparent program. See section 2.1 for what the funding transaction looks like when instantiated using WTPs.

**Token Descriptions**. There are three types of tokens described in this section: (1) channel token, (2) closure token, and (3) revocation token.

(a) *Channel token*: this consists of public keys from the customer and merchant for the channel and a long-lived public key for the merchant. It also includes the initial customer balance and optionally, the wallet commitment.
(b) *Closure token*: for the customer, this consists of the wallet (i.e., the channel public key, wallet public key, current channal balance, total channel balance), and a closure signature (i.e., blinded sig) on the wallet.
(c) *Revocation token*: this consists of a wallet public key and a corresponding revocation signature.

2.1 Funding Transaction
-------------
The funding transaction is by default funded by only one participant, the customer. We will be extending the protocol to allow for dual-funded channels.

This transaction has 2 shielded inputs (but can be up to some N) and 1 transparent output with a WTP and the predicate is the customer and merchant public keys. Note that the customer can specify as many shielded inputs as necessary to fund the channel sufficiently (limited only by the overall transaction size).

* ``lock_time``: 0
* ``nExpiryHeight``: 0
* ``valueBalance``: funding amount + transaction fee
* ``nShieldedSpend``: 1 or N (if funded by both customer and merchant)
* ``vShieldedSpend[0]``: tx for customerâ€™s note commitment and nullifier for the coins

  - ``cv``: commitment for the input note
  - ``root``: root hash of note commitment tree at some block height
  - ``nullifier``: unique serial number of the input note
  - ``rk``: randomized pubkey for spendAuthSig
  - ``zkproof``: zero-knowledge proof for the note
  - ``spendAuthSig``: signature authorizing the spend

* ``vShieldedSpend[1..N]``: additional tx for customer's note commitment and nullifier for the coins

  - ``cv``: commitment for the input note
  - ``root``: root hash of note commitment tree at some block height
  - ``nullifier``: unique serial number of the input note
  - ``rk``: randomized pubkey for spendAuthSig
  - ``zkproof``: zero-knowledge proof for the note
  - ``spendAuthSig``: signature authorizing the spend
* ``tx_out_count``: 1
* ``tx_out``: (via a transparent program)

  - ``scriptPubKey``: ``PROGRAM PUSHDATA( <bolt_close> || <<cust-pubkey> || <merch-pubkey> || <channel-token>> )``

where the ``<bolt_close>`` type corresponds to the following logic (expressed in ``Script`` for convenience):

	OP_IF
	  2 <cust-pubkey> <merch-pubkey> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
	OP_ELSE
	  <cust-pubkey> OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY 1 OP_BOLT
	OP_ENDIF

* ``bindingSig``: a signature that proves that (1) the total value spent by Spend transfers - Output transfers = value balance field.

The customer (in collaboration with the merchant) creates their initial closing transaction before sending the funding transaction to the network (since  the customer needs to know they can get their money back). Once both customer and merchant closing transactions have been created, the customer should broadcast the funding transaction and waits for the network to confirm the transaction. After the transaction has been confirmed, the payment channel is established.

2.2 Closing Transactions
-------------
2.2.1 Customer closing transaction
----
The customer closing transaction is generated by the customer during the channel establishment but is not broadcast to the network. The customer's closing transaction (below) contains two outputs: (1) an output that can be spent immediately by the merchant and (2) another output that can be spent by either the customer after a relative timeout or the merchant with a revocation token. This approach allows the merchant to see the customer's closing transaction and spend the output with a revocation token if the customer posted an outdated closure token.

The customer's closing transaction is described below.

* ``version``: specify version number
* ``groupid``: specify group id
* ``locktime``: should be set such that closing transactions can be included in a current block.
* ``txin`` count: 1

   - ``txin[0]`` outpoint: references the funding transaction txid and output_index
   - ``txin[0]`` script bytes: 0
   - ``txin[0]`` script sig: ``PROGRAM PUSHDATA( <bolt_close> || <<customer> || <closing-token> || <cust-sig>> )``

* ``txout`` count: 2
* ``txouts``:

  * ``to_customer``: a timelocked WTP output sending funds back to the customer with a time delay.
      - ``amount``: balance paid back to customer
      - ``nSequence: <time-delay>``
      - ``scriptPubKey``: ``PROGRAM PUSHDATA( <bolt_cust_spend> || <<cust-pubkey> || <merch-pubkey> || <revocation-pubkey>>  )``

  * ``to_merchant``: A WTP output to merch-pubkey output (sending funds back to the merchant), i.e.
      * ``scriptPubKey``: ``PROGRAM PUSHDATA( <bolt_cust_spend> || <merch-pubkey> )``
      * ``amount``: balance paid to merchant
      * ``nSequence``: 0

To redeem the ``to_customer`` output, the customer presents a ``scriptSig`` with the customer signature after a time delay as follows:

	``PROGRAM PUSHDATA( <bolt_cust_spend> || <<customer> || <cust-sig> || <time-delay>> )``

where the ``<bolt_cust_spend>`` type corresponds to the following logic (expressed in ``Script`` for convenience):

	``OP_IF``
	  ``<revocation-pubkey> <merch-pubkey> 2 OP_BOLT``
	``OP_ELSE``
	  ``<time-delay> OP_CSV OP_DROP <cust-pubkey> OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY``
	``OP_ENDIF``

In the event of a dispute, the merchant can redeem the ``to_customer`` by posting a transaction ``scriptSig`` as follows:

	``PROGRAM PUSHDATA( <bolt_script> || <<merchant> || <revocation-token> || <merch-sig>>)``

2.2.2 Merchant closing transaction
----
The merchant can create their own initial closing transaction as follows.

* ``version``: specify version number
* ``groupid``: specify group id
* ``locktime``: should be set such that closing transactions can be included in a current block.
* ``txin`` count: 1

   - ``txin[0]`` outpoint: references the funding transaction txid and output_index
   - ``txin[0]`` script bytes: 0
   - ``txin[0]`` script sig: ``PROGRAM PUSHDATA( <bolt_close> || <<merchant> || <cust-sig> || <merch-sig>> )``

* ``txout`` count: 1
* ``txouts``:

  * ``to_merchant``: a timelocked WTP output sending all the funds in the channel back to the merchant with a time delay
      - ``amount``: balance paid back to merchant
      - ``nSequence: <time-delay>``
      - ``scriptPubKey``: ``PROGRAM PUSHDATA( <bolt_merch_script> || <<cust-pubkey> || <merch-pubkey> )``

where the ``<bolt_merch_script>`` type corresponds to the following logic (expressed in ``Script`` for convenience):

		OP_IF
	  	  <cust-pubkey> OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY 1 OP_BOLT
		OP_ELSE
		  <time-delay> OP_CSV OP_DROP <merch-pubkey> OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY
		OP_ENDIF

After each payment on the channel, the customer obtains a closing token for the updated channel balance and provides the merchant a revocation token for the previous state along with the associated wallet public key (this invalidates the pub key). If the customer initiated closing, the merchant can use the revocation token to spend the funds of the channel if the customer posts an outdated closing transaction.

2.3 Channel Closing
-------------
To close the channel, the customer can initiate by posting the most recent closing transaction that spends from the multi-signature transparent address with inputs that satisfies the script and the ``OP_BOLT`` opcode in mode 1. This consists of a closing token (i.e., merchant signature on the wallet state) or an opening of the initial wallet commitment (if there were no payments on the channel).

Once the timeout has been reached, the customer can post a transaction that claims the output of the customer closing transaction to a shielded output (see below for an example). Before the timeout, the merchant can claim the funds from the ``to_customer`` output by posting a revocation token, if they have one.

The merchant can immediately claim the ``to_merchant`` output from the customer closing transaction to a shielded address by presenting their P2PKH address.

Because we do not know how to encumber the outputs of shielded outputs right now, we will rely on a standard transaction to move funds from the closing transaction into a shielded address as follows:

* ``version``: 2
* ``groupid``: specify group id
* ``locktime``: 0
* ``txin`` count: 1
   * ``txin[0]`` outpoint: ``txid`` and ``output_index``
   * ``txin[0]`` sequence: 0xFFFFFFFF
   * ``txin[0]`` script bytes: 0
   * ``txin[0]`` script sig: ``0 <cust-sig> <merch-sig>``
* ``nShieldedOutput``: 1
* ``vShieldedOutput[0]``:
   - ``cv``: commitment for the output note
   - ``cmu``: ...
   - ``ephemeralKey``:ephemeral public key
   - ``encCiphertext``: encrypted output note (part 1)
   - ``outCiphertext``: encrypted output note (part 2)
   - ``zkproof``: zero-knowledge proof for the note

The merchant can initiate closing by posting the initial closing transaction from establishing the channel that pays the merchant the full balance of the channel with a time lock that allows for customer dispute. After the time delay, the merchant can then post a separate standard transaction that moves the claimed funds to a shielded address.
